    "*Observation which deviates so much from other observations as to arouse suspicion it was generated by a different mechanism*<br>\n",
    "*--- Hawkings (1980)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers are extreme values that deviate from other observations on data , they may indicate a variability in a measurement, experimental errors or a novelty. In other words, an **outlier is an observation that diverges from an overall pattern on a sample.** Outliers can be of two kinds: univariate and multivariate. Univariate outliers can be found when looking at a distribution of values in a single feature space. Multivariate outliers can be found in a n-dimensional space (of n-features). Looking at distributions in n-dimensional spaces can be very difficult for the human brain, that is why we need to train a model to do it for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can also come in different flavours, depending on the environment: point outliers, contextual outliers, or collective outliers. Point outliers are single data points that lay far from the rest of the distribution. Contextual outliers can be noise in data, such as punctuation symbols when realizing text analysis or background noise signal when doing speech recognition. Collective outliers can be subsets of novelties in data such as a signal that may indicate the discovery of new phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process of producing, collecting, processing and analyzing data, outliers can come from many sources and hide in many dimensions. Those that are not a product of an error are called **novelties**. Detecting outliers is of major importance for almost any quantitative discipline (ie: Physics, Economy, Finance, Machine Learning, Cyber Security). In machine learning and in any quantitative discipline the quality of data is as important as the quality of a prediction or classification model."

    "### Outliers on this Dataset\n",
    "Considering that the data follows Gaussian-like distribution. If we know that the distribution of values in the sample is Gaussian or Gaussian-like, we can use the standard deviation of the sample as a cut-off for identifying outliers. The Gaussian distribution has the property that the standard deviation from the mean can be used to reliably summarize the percentage of values in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the mean is 28.2 and the standard deviation is 6.5 for module 34.B2.9F.A9, then all data in the sample between 34.7 and 21.7 will account for about 68% of the data sample. We can cover more of the data sample if we expand the range as follows: 1 Standard Deviation from the Mean: 68% ;2 Standard Deviations from the Mean: 95%; 3 Standard Deviations from the Mean: 99.7, 3.5 STD from Mean 99.9%.\n",
    "\n",
    "A value that falls outside of 3 standard deviations is part of the distribution, but it is an unlikely or rare event at approximately 1 in 370 samples. Three standard deviations from the mean is a common cut-off in practice for identifying outliers in a Gaussian or Gaussian-like distribution. For smaller samples of data, perhaps a value of 2 standard deviations (95%) can be used, and for larger samples, perhaps a value of 4 standard deviations (99.9%) can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Given mu and sigma, a simple way to identify outliers is to compute a z-score for every xi, which is defined as the number of standard deviations away xi is from the mean […] Data values that have a z-score sigma greater than a threshold, for example, of three, are declared to be outliers.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all data is normal or normal enough to treat it as being drawn from a Gaussian distribution. A good statistic for summarizing a non-Gaussian distribution sample of data is the Interquartile Range, or IQR for short. The IQR can be used to identify outliers by defining limits on the sample values that are a factor k of the IQR below the 25th percentile or above the 75th percentile. The common value for the factor k is the value 1.5. A factor k of 3 or more can be used to identify values that are extreme outliers or “far outs” when described in the context of box and whisker plots. On a box and whisker plot, these limits are drawn as fences on the whiskers (or the lines) that are drawn from the box. Values that fall outside of these values are drawn as dots. We can calculate the percentiles of a dataset using the `percentile()` NumPy function that takes the dataset and specification of the desired percentile. The IQR can then be calculated as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This methods aren't very accurate, cause they don't discriminate between outliers and novelties, in order to do so is needed a better anomaly detection method."
